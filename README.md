# LoRaHAM_Daemon - Device Driver

*Deutsch: [README.de.md](README.de.md)*

**LoRaHAM_Daemon is the hardware driver for LoRa radios on a Raspberry Pi.** It owns the
SPI-attached radio chip and exposes it on UNIX sockets, so an application can send, receive and
configure the radio without touching the hardware itself — high-power LoRa with long range on a
single-board computer, for amateur radio.

It is written for the **LoRaHAM_Pi HAT** and the **LoRaHAM Cartridge**, and also supports the
Uputronics Pi Zero LoRa boards and the Waveshare SX1262 HAT. Other boards should work too: what it
needs is an SX1276, SX1278 or SX1262 wired directly to the Pi's SPI bus, and a `--hw` preset whose
wiring matches.

## Hardware

* Raspberry Pi 3/4/5, Raspbian image
* SPI enabled with the `spi0-0cs` overlay — [how](docs/hardware.md)
* 433 MHz and 868 MHz, one daemon process per band

Supported radio boards, selected with `--hw`:

| `--hw` | Board |
|---|---|
| `loraham` | **[LoRaHAM_Pi HAT / LoRaHAM Cartridge](https://www.loraham.de/produkt/loraham-pi/)** — the [LoRaHAM project's](https://loraham.de) own dual-module board, SX1278 for 433 MHz + RFM95 for 868 MHz |
| `uputronics-ce0`, `uputronics-ce1` | [Uputronics Raspberry Pi Zero LoRa Expansion Board](https://store.uputronics.com) — RFM95/RFM98; one board for a single band, or two stacked for dual-band. The preset picks the chip select and pins, not the band: `--radio` decides that, so either board can serve either band |
| `waveshare-sx1262` | [Waveshare SX1262 LoRaWAN/GNSS HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/SX1262_XXXM_LoRaWAN/GNSS_HAT) — 433M and 868M variants. **SPI only**: the daemon drives the SX1262 chip directly, so the HAT's GNSS receiver is unused and this is not a LoRaWAN gateway or concentrator setup. No FSK streaming and no board LED on this board, and it cannot be combined with an Uputronics board — the pins collide |

Any HAT whose radio is an **SX1276**, **SX1278** or **SX1262** wired directly to the Pi's SPI bus
should work — pick the preset whose wiring matches. Wiring, capability flags, the combination
matrix and how to add a board are in [`docs/hardware.md`](docs/hardware.md).

## Three ways to run it

### With LoRaHAM_Pi Control

**[LoRaHAM_Pi Control (LHPC)](https://github.com/makrohard/loraham-pi-control) installs and runs
all of this for you**, from a web UI, on a box you flash and forget. There are
**[ready-made SD-card images](https://github.com/makrohard/loraham-images)** — flash one, boot,
open the web UI, pick your hardware and start a stack. It builds the daemon from this repository,
pins it to a tested commit, and manages the radios, the sockets and the systemd units.

The nine stacks it can run:

| Stack | What it is |
|---|---|
| LoRaHAM daemon | the daemon on its own, one process per band |
| LoRaHAM Chat | the APRS/chat TUI from [`clients/`](clients/), on 433 |
| LoRaHAM Voice | Codec2 voice over LoRa, GTK on a desktop or ncurses on a Lite box |
| LoRaHAM KISS TNC | KISS/TCP TNC on port 8001 for APRS clients, optional serial PTY |
| Graywolf APRS | APRS station with web UI, digipeater and iGate, through the KISS TNC |
| Meshtastic | native `meshtasticd` on the RF95, run rootless |
| MeshCom | MeshCom firmware under QEMU, bridged to the daemon |
| MeshCore | MeshCore on openHop, 868, chat node and/or repeater |
| Reticulum | RNS node driving the radio directly over SPI |

### Build the daemon yourself

[`loraham_daemon/`](loraham_daemon/) is the tree under active development: one process per band,
instance and GPIO locks, CAD/LBT, a framed DATA protocol, systemd units and a test suite. Build and
run it in three commands — [`loraham_daemon/README.md`](loraham_daemon/README.md).

The reference documentation is in [`docs/`](docs/):

| | |
|---|---|
| [Hardware](docs/hardware.md) | Packages, RadioLib, SPI, board presets, wiring, two boards on one Pi |
| [Deployment](docs/deployment.md) | systemd, users and groups, sockets on disk, locks, exit codes |
| [Command line](docs/cli.md) | Every flag, and the RF settings each band starts with |
| [CONF protocol](docs/conf-protocol.md) | Configuring the radio at runtime: commands, parameters, queries, replies |
| [DATA protocol](docs/data-protocol.md) | The raw and framed wire formats |
| [Limits and timing](docs/limits.md) | Sizes, timeouts, TX modes, CAD behaviour |
| [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | Module map and runtime design |
| [Examples](docs/examples.md) | Short programs that talk to the daemon, in shell, Python and C |

### The archived daemons

[`archive/`](archive/) holds the single-file daemons, both bands in one process. They remain
available and buildable, and [`archive/README.md`](archive/README.md) has everything needed to do
it: prerequisites, RadioLib, the compile lines and how to run them.

### Clients

[`clients/`](clients/) has the programs that talk to the daemon — the
[chat TUI](clients/chat/README.md), the [APRS iGate](clients/igate/README.md), dual-band RSSI bars
and a Meshtastic decryptor. Start the daemon first, then a client.

Working on the code: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Write your own client

The daemon is a device driver with a socket interface, which means anything that can open a UNIX
socket can drive the radio — no SPI, no RadioLib, no C required unless you want it.

[**Examples**](docs/examples.md) has the shortest programs that do something real: ask the daemon
how it is with one line of `socat`, transmit from a shell one-liner, then receive and transmit in
Python, C and JavaScript. Every command and program on that page was run against a real daemon on
real hardware, and the outputs shown are what came back.

Start there, change the payload, and watch `GET CHANNEL` while you move an antenna.
