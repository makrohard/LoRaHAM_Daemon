 * The concrete RadioDriver for the SX127x family (SX1278 on 433, RFM95 on
 * 868). In RadioLib, RFM95 is an SX1276 alias and inherits from SX1278; the
 * object is held as an SX1278* and every chip-specific method (begin,
 * beginFSK, setFrequency, ...) is virtual and dispatches correctly.
 *
 * Every SX127x register constant (RegRssiValue 0x1B, RegRssiValueFSK 0x11,
 * RegVersion 0x42) lives exclusively in sx127x_driver.cpp.

     * RadioLib's version waits on `while(!digitalRead(DIO0))` and polls DIO1
     * for the detection, so a board that does not route DIO1 -- the Uputronics
     * expansion board -- can never observe CadDetected and reports CHANNEL_FREE
     * for every scan, including a busy channel. The datasheet (SX1276/77/78/79,
     * p.44) states that CadDone and CadDetected are asserted TOGETHER on a
     * successful correlation, and both are latched in RegIrqFlags -- so one
     * register read yields the complete verdict, with no ordering question and
     * no wired interrupt line. This is what RadioLib itself does on SX126x and
     * LR11x0; SX127x is the sole outlier.
     *
     * Returns RADIOLIB_CHANNEL_FREE, RADIOLIB_PREAMBLE_DETECTED (the same value
     * the blocking implementation returned when DIO1 fired), or a negative
     * RadioLib error. A hardware-deadline expiry is RADIOLIB_ERR_RX_TIMEOUT,
     * which the daemon maps to UNAVAILABLE: an indeterminate scan ends the TX
     * attempt and must never be flattened into BUSY, or CADTXAFTERTIMEOUT would
     * let a sequence of broken scans reach send-anyway.

     * decode at SF11/BW250; the runtime SET LDRO=AUTO path did not, so the
     * same stale bit could survive a CONFIG command that reported success.
     *
     * The fix is the boot rule, used by both: compute from the CURRENT SF/BW,
     * forceLDRO(computed) so the register is definitely right NOW, then
     * autoLDRO() so RadioLib keeps maintaining it across later SF/BW changes.
