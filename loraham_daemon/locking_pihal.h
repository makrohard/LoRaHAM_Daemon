/*
 * PiHal that serializes every SPI transaction across processes (and across
 * bands within one process) using a process-shared advisory flock.
 *
 * Why this is the correct interception point:
 *   RadioLib's Module brackets each transfer as
 *       spiBeginTransaction(); CS-low; spiTransfer(); CS-high; spiEndTransaction();
 *   (RadioLib/src/Module.cpp). Taking the lock in spiBeginTransaction() and
 *   releasing it in spiEndTransaction() protects exactly one complete SPI
 *   transaction -- never the whole daemon lifetime. The bus is free between
 *   transactions, so complete transactions to the two radios (each on its own
 *   CS line) may interleave, which is what a shared SPI bus permits.
 *
 * Why per-instance descriptors:
 *   Each radio constructs its own LockingPiHal with its own open descriptor on
 *   the same lock file; flock() on distinct open file descriptions is mutually
 *   exclusive, giving correct serialization between two separate per-band
 *   daemons sharing /dev/spidev0.0.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED (production invariant):
 *   No SPI transfer may proceed unless the process-shared lock is confirmed
 *   held. If the trusted lock directory/file cannot be opened, spi_lock_ready()
 *   returns false and the daemon refuses to start that radio. There is no /tmp
 *   fallback. A hard (non-EINTR) flock() failure, or any attempt to transfer
 *   without the lock held, triggers a controlled fatal exit rather than an
 *   unsynchronized bus access.
 *
 * Lock ordering: callers hold the per-band radio_mutex before any SPI call, and
 * this flock is the lowest-level lock taken last -- no inverse path, no deadlock.
 */
/* SPI transactions are µs–ms; 2 s of contention on the shared bus lock can
 * only mean a wedged peer process. */

    /* ---- GPIO ownership ------------------------------------------------
     * Same reasoning as the SPI ownership above, and the same failure. The
     * base PiHal logs a failed lgpio call and carries on, and its digitalRead
     * returns lgGpioRead()'s int through a uint32_t -- so a negative error
     * code (LG_BAD_HANDLE is -5) comes back as 4294967291, which every
     * RadioLib caller reads as a logic HIGH. That is not a cosmetic wart:
     *
     *   SX127x::transmit() waits `while(!digitalRead(irq))`. A truthy error
     *   makes the condition false, the wait loop never runs once, and control
     *   falls through to finishTransmit() -- which returns SUCCESS and puts
     *   the radio in standby. The transmission is cut short on air and the
     *   daemon logs the frame as sent. scanChannel() has the same shape and
     *   returns CHANNEL_FREE, so a broken GPIO tells listen-before-talk the
     *   channel is clear.
     *
     * Worse, the base init() STORES the negative result as the handle, so
     * every later read fails the same way for the life of the process, and
     * its `if(_gpioHandle != -1) return;` guard then treats that poisoned
     * handle as "already initialised" and refuses to retry.
     *
     * So this HAL owns the GPIO handle exactly as it owns the SPI handle. A
     * negative lgpio result is never an electrical level. Before the radio is
     * operational it latches a startup failure (the daemon must then refuse
     * READY and exit non-restartable, rather than restart-loop on a box whose
     * wiring is wrong); after it, radio I/O integrity is lost and we exit the
     * restartable way, as the SPI path already does.
     *
     * NOTE on pull-up flags: PiHal keeps `pinFlags` private and only
     * pullUpDown() ever writes it. Nothing in this daemon or in the SX127x
     * path calls pullUpDown, so the flags are always 0 -- which is what is
     * passed below. If a profile ever needs pulls, this is the place. */
