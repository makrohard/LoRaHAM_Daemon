# Changelog

## 0.11.0

The reliability run. Seven repairs from an external hardware audit, three review
rounds on top of them, and two hygiene changes. Proven on two boxes and on the
air; the open item is recorded at the end.

Breaking:
- `POWER` on SX127x boards is now `2`–`17` dBm, not `0`–`20`. Below `2`,
  RadioLib drives the **RFO** pin instead of PA_BOOST — a different output path,
  and not the one the antenna is on, so `POWER=0` meant "transmit into an
  unconnected pin" while reporting success. Above `17`, RadioLib itself rejects
  `18` and `19`, and `20` is declined deliberately because its +20 dBm path
  carries a duty-cycle contract this daemon does not enforce. SX1262 keeps
  `0`–`20`.
- FSK frames on SX127x are limited to **63** payload bytes. The FIFO is 64 and
  variable-length mode puts the length byte in it. Oversized framed frames are
  rejected as `INVALID_PACKET` before anything is queued or the radio is
  touched; raw DATA input is chunked to the limit instead. LoRa keeps 255.
- **All log output is English**, and every line on stdout *and* stderr now
  begins with a UTC timestamp (`2026-09-16T08:22:31.003Z `). Anything grepping
  the old German strings must be updated; the CONF wire protocol, its keys and
  values, and the RF-log format are unchanged.
- Exit `4` now means "startup prerequisite unavailable — lock infrastructure
  **or** GPIO", not lock infrastructure alone. Exit `5` is renamed to
  `LORAHAM_EXIT_RUNTIME_RADIO_IO_ERROR` and logs `[RADIO] FATAL`, since GPIO
  failures exit through it too; the number is unchanged and the old macro name
  remains as an alias.

Radio behaviour:
- **CAD is read from the chip's registers instead of a pin.** RadioLib's SX127x
  `scanChannel()` waits on DIO0 and polls DIO1, so a board that does not route
  DIO1 could never see `CadDetected` and reported a free channel for every scan.
  The driver now polls the latched `CadDone`/`CadDetected` bits in `RegIrqFlags`
  against a deadline computed from the current SF/BW. **Uputronics therefore has
  real listen-before-talk and reports `CADSCAN=1`**; it previously fell back to
  the RSSI threshold.
- A CAD that never completes is an error, not a verdict. It ends the transmit
  attempt and can never be converted into a send by `CADTXAFTERTIMEOUT`.
- A received packet is no longer destroyed by a channel probe. The probe stops
  the receiver, checks both its own flag and the chip's latched `RxDone`, and
  abandons the scan if either says a packet is waiting. A pending packet also
  ends a synchronous MANAGED transmit immediately rather than being carried into
  the timeout decision.
- `GET CHANNEL` outside LoRa, or while an RX re-arm is pending, answers
  `CADSCAN=0 CADSTATE=UNAVAILABLE` **before touching the radio**. It still
  reports an RSSI in FSK, now through the skip-receive read — the ordinary one
  re-enters RX and clears every IRQ flag.
- `READY` now means configured radio **+ usable IRQ path + armed RX**. It was
  previously set before the packet-received callback was installed, whose result
  was discarded, so a radio whose IRQ line was never claimed could report READY
  and stay silent.
- A GPIO call that fails can no longer look like a pin level. RadioLib returned
  the error code through a `uint32_t`, making it read as a logic HIGH — which
  ended `transmit()`'s wait immediately and returned success, and told
  listen-before-talk the channel was clear.
- `SET LDRO=AUTO` now writes the register. RadioLib's `autoLDRO()` only sets a
  flag, so on a board without a RESET line a stale bit survived a restart while
  the command reported success.
- Output power and the PA over-current limit are one setting, re-applied at
  boot, on every `SET POWER` and after every modem switch. RadioLib pins OCP to
  60 mA inside both `begin()` and `beginFSK()` — below the 87 mA the PA draws at
  +17 dBm — so protection could trip during ordinary transmission. The daemon
  sets **100 mA, the chip's silicon default**.

Notes for operators:
- Do not poll `GET CHANNEL` back to back: the probe declines rather than waiting
  when the TX worker holds the radio or a packet is undrained.
- On a board with no RESET line, `READY` does not prove the antenna path works.
  A receiver can come up deaf after repeated restarts; a `SET MODE=FSK` then
  `SET MODE=LORA` round trip recovers it without a power cycle. See
  `docs/hardware.md`.
- FSK between two crystal-referenced boards is less forgiving than LoRa. If a
  link is poor where LoRa is fine, widen `RXBW` on the receiving side.

Open:
- The 100 mA OCP value is the documented silicon default, not a measured one. No
  current meter was available. If measurement shows +17 dBm into a real mismatch
  needs more headroom, the number should rise.

## 0.10.0

- RF log: `--rflog on|off --rflog-path <absolute>` appends one line per RF frame the
  radio received (with RSSI/SNR) or transmitted (with outcome, after `transmit()`
  returned OK — a CAD refusal or radio error never radiated and is not logged).
  Raw payload as hex and ASCII. Capped at 5 MB by copy-truncate to `<path>.1`; the
  inode never changes, so an external truncate is tolerated. `on` without a path,
  or an unopenable path, refuses to start rather than silently not logging.
- `docs/data-protocol.md`: framed RX frames carry RSSI/SNR in their header; the
  "payload only" sentence was stale.

## 0.9.0

**This entry is where the version scheme changes.** Everything before it was a plain
counter, and `112` was its last value; from here the daemon uses semantic versions.
Nothing about its behaviour changes with this entry.

- Repository restructured: the reference documentation moved out of the daemon's
  README into `docs/`, one subject per page; the client programs into `clients/`;
  the single-file daemons into `archive/`. `loraham_daemon/README.md` is now what
  the daemon is and how to build and run it.
- Every factual claim in the old manual was checked against the source. The
  documentation now describes what the code does -- socket ownership and modes,
  exit codes including the restartable runtime SPI failure, the raw DATA stream
  contract, the SX1262 parameter rasters, and the `--hw` presets.
- `test_multi_instance` no longer reports SKIP when a daemon fails to start on a
  machine that has radio hardware; it checks for the hardware first and fails
  otherwise, like the other live-daemon tests.
- CI runs each ref in its own concurrency group.

## loraham_daemon 112

Breaking:
- `--radio 433|868` is now mandatory (no `--radio both` / implicit default); dual-band runs two processes.
- Band-suffixed flags removed (`--tx-mode-433/868`, `--cad-monitor-433/868`, `--cad-rssi-433/868`); the plain flags apply to the selected band.
- CONF now sends one reply per command: `OK` or `ERR MALFORMED|UNKNOWN|INVALID|BUSY|RADIO_NOT_READY|HARDWARE` (`GET STATUS/STATS/CHANNEL` keep their data line, no trailing `OK`). Parsers must consume it.
- Public sockets moved to `/run/loraham` under systemd; direct/user runs use `LORAHAM_SOCKET_DIR=/tmp`. Bundled clients auto-detect both.
- Daemon runs unprivileged as the `loraham` user (hardware via spi/gpio groups); `GET STATUS` gains `RXREADY`, `GET STATS` gains `RXREARMFAIL`.

Behavior:
- `SET FREQ` is rejected off the selected band (433: 430–440 MHz, 868: 863–870); slow configs are rejected by a 20 s worst-case airtime limit.
- `SET TXQUEUE=0` and radio-touching `SET`s are rejected (`ERR BUSY`) while the TX queue is draining.
- `SET MODE` re-applies the band's boot RF defaults; boot fails closed if any RF setter or RX-arm fails; a persistently deaf receiver escalates to `RADIO=FAILED`.
- MANAGED TX aborts on a failed/unavailable CAD probe instead of treating it as free; a pending RX packet is no longer destroyed by a CAD probe or a rejected CONF line.
- Per-process GPIO/SPI locks fail the boot closed on conflict; startup lock failures exit 4 (no restart), runtime SPI fatals exit 5 (restartable), duplicate instance exits 3.
- SX1262: all `OOK`, `ENCODING=1`, and `FREQDEV<0.6` rejected at prevalidation; RF-switch failure now fails closed.

New hardware:
- Uputronics Raspberry Pi Zero LoRa(TM) Expansion Board V2.5C.
- Waveshare SX1262 LoRaWAN/GNSS HAT.

## loraham_daemon 111a
- loraham_daemon can now safely run multiple instances
- CAD monitor: fixed lost `CAD=0` when RX was pending; free now confirms after 2 samples 3 dB below `CADRSSI`

## loraham_daemon 111

- CAD/TX was reworked: MANAGED TX now performs bounded CAD/LBT with a stable
  idle window and returns `CHANNEL_BUSY` on timeout (default 1.5 s) instead of
  transmitting, while DIRECT TX transmits immediately with no CAD gating
  (selectable at boot per band via `--tx-mode`/`--tx-mode-433`/`--tx-mode-868`
  or at runtime via `SET TXMODE`); legacy/raw clients need `DIRECT` for
  backward compatibility. Per-band CAD policy
  (CADWAIT/CADIDLE/CADPOLL/CADTXAFTERTIMEOUT) is now configurable via CONF and
  reported in `GET STATUS`.
- DATA TX now runs through a bounded async queue, enabled by default
  (`SET TXQUEUE=0` keeps the direct path). Daemon-owned worker threads own the
  CAD/LBT decision, queued jobs retain their CAD callback, and completions are
  delivered in the main loop as final `TX_RESULT` frames with preserved sequence
  numbers and client-slot generation checks.
- RadioLib access now uses a per-radio guard across TX, RX, CAD, RSSI,
  monitoring, and CONFIG apply. CAD probes restore LoRa RX after scanning, and
  CAD monitoring uses a dedicated broadcast latch, scanning at most every 200 ms
  and only for subscribed CONF clients.
- Status and framed protocol were extended: `GET CHANNEL` reports per-band
  radio/CAD/RSSI/mode/TXMODE snapshots (LIVERSSI, CADSCAN, CADSTATE, PACKETRSSI)
  and returns immediately during active TX; framed `TX_RESULT` is configurable
  per band; STATUS exposes queue and completion counters including
  `TXQRESULTDROP`.
- Shutdown now discards queued TX jobs while letting only the in-flight job
  finish and rejects jobs submitted after shutdown begins. Async completion
  statistics use an atomic worker-to-runtime handoff and stay in sync with
  `GET STATS`/`GET STATUS`.
- Build, test, and operational hardening: release builds are hardened and CI
  runs pinned-RadioLib normal/strict/ASan-UBSan/TSan suites with TX-worker
  stress coverage; sockets use 0660 with a restrictive daemon umask; epoll
  supports 128 FDs and stops cleanly on registration errors; the per-band
  activity LED is driven by a single derived-state writer (transmit or
  CAD/channel busy) so it can no longer latch on, with partial-claim cleanup.
  README documents the current TX/CAD/queue/completion/CONF interfaces.
- Replaced per-loop epoll reset/re-registration with persistent watch
  reconciliation, dynamic EPOLLOUT interest, stale-watch cleanup, FD-reuse
  protection, and regression coverage.

## loraham_daemon 109

Refactoring by Johannes Loose
Initial version: loradaemon_320_108 by Alexander Walter

- Refactor / Hardening
  - Event loop: moved polling/socket loop toward event-backend structure with test coverage.
  - Socket handling: hardened client slots, nonblocking I/O, queued broadcasts, and slow-client behavior.
  - RadioController/OOP: replaced radio globals and centralized 433/868 runtime state in `RadioController`.
  - Radio lifecycle: moved RadioLib objects to `std::unique_ptr` ownership with explicit shutdown.
  - TX path: routed DATA-TX, CAD guard, band/mode/health, and send flow through `RadioController`.
  - RX path: structured RX packet flow, IRQ/FIFO handling, and broadcast path through `RadioController`.
  - CAD/RSSI: routed polling and RSSI streaming through controller state instead of legacy mirrors.
  - CONFIG path: CONFIG dispatch now uses `RadioController` as runtime/hardware source.
  - TX logging: show compact TX packet preview in normal output.
  - TX logging: print full normal-mode ASCII packet preview.
  - LED path: radio-flow LED handling now goes through `RadioController`.
  - Logging module: extracted logger implementation into `daemon_log.h/.cpp`.
  - Test hardening: expanded structural guards and integration/regression coverage in `run_tests.sh`.
  - Harden RX packet handling: validate RX lengths, drop invalid packets safely, and avoid parsing short LoRa payloads as metadata.
  - Harden CONFIG command validation: require exact SET commands and reject unknown CONFIG keys.
  - Harden CONFIG apply: abort remaining changes after failed MODE switch and defer GETRSSI until mode switching succeeds.

- Bugfixes
  - Fix CONFIG stream framing: fragmented commands are buffered and newline-separated commands are processed individually.
  - Fix client broadcast errors: failed writes close broken clients instead of keeping stale slots.
  - Fix client slot overflow: accepted clients without a free slot are closed instead of leaked.
  - Fix FSK SHAPING parsing: BT values now map to RadioLib constants instead of truncating to 0.
  - Fix TX bounds checks: invalid or oversized packets are rejected before copy/transmit.
  - Fix RX error forwarding: RadioLib CRC/header/read errors are dropped and counted.
  
- New Features  
  - Build Script `./build.sh`  
  - Testsuite `./run_tests.sh`  
  - Debug logging`--debug`  
  - Added `--help`  
  - Version now lives in `daemon_version.h`
  - Added one-radio-mode --radio 433 | 868 | both
  - Add framed DATA sockets with packet-boundary-preserving TX/RX frames, shared-radio behavior
