## loraham_daemon 109

Refactoring by Johannes Loose
Initial version: loradaemon_320_108

- Refactor / Hardening
  - Event loop: moved polling/socket loop toward event-backend structure with test coverage.
  - Socket handling: hardened client slots, nonblocking I/O, queued broadcasts, and slow-client behavior.
  - RadioController/OOP: replaced radio globals and centralized 433/868 runtime state in `RadioController`.
  - Radio lifecycle: moved RadioLib objects to `std::unique_ptr` ownership with explicit shutdown.
  - TX path: routed DATA-TX, CAD guard, band/mode/health, and send flow through `RadioController`.
  - RX path: structured RX packet flow, IRQ/FIFO handling, and broadcast path through `RadioController`.
  - CAD/RSSI: routed polling and RSSI streaming through controller state instead of legacy mirrors.
  - CONFIG path: CONFIG dispatch now uses `RadioController` as runtime/hardware source.
  - LED path: radio-flow LED handling now goes through `RadioController`.
  - Logging module: extracted logger implementation into `daemon_log.h/.cpp`.
  - Test hardening: expanded structural guards and integration/regression coverage in `run_tests.sh`.

- Bugfixes
  - Fix CONFIG stream framing: fragmented commands are buffered and newline-separated commands are processed individually.
  - Fix client broadcast errors: failed writes close broken clients instead of keeping stale slots.
  - Fix client slot overflow: accepted clients without a free slot are closed instead of leaked.
  - Fix FSK SHAPING parsing: BT values now map to RadioLib constants instead of truncating to 0.
  - Fix TX bounds checks: invalid or oversized packets are rejected before copy/transmit.
  - Fix RX error forwarding: RadioLib CRC/header/read errors are dropped and counted.
