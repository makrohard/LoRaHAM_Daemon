# DATA protocol

This page is the wire specification for the two payload interfaces of the daemon: the raw DATA sockets and the framed DATA sockets. It covers frame layout, field widths, byte order, size limits, RX metadata and `TX_RESULT`. It does not describe the CONF command set that switches these behaviours on — see [CONF protocol](conf-protocol.md) — nor the socket paths on disk, which are in [Deployment](deployment.md), nor the queue and CAD timings behind a TX result, which are in [Limits and timing](limits.md).

## Raw DATA sockets

Raw DATA sockets are byte streams. They have no line protocol and no length prefix, and **a
client's `write()` calls do not define RF packet boundaries**: the daemon transmits whatever one
`read()` returns, split into packets of at most `255` bytes. Two quick writes can arrive together
and go out as one packet; one large write can arrive in pieces. Use the framed sockets when packet
boundaries matter.

| Action | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Client writes bytes to a DATA socket | The daemon transmits them on the matching band |
| More than `255` bytes arrive at once | The daemon splits what it read into RF packets of at most `255` bytes |
| RF packet is received | The daemon broadcasts the raw bytes to all connected DATA clients of that band |

```bash
printf 'Hello LoRaHAM\n' | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/run/loraham/lora433.sock
```

```bash
echo "FFFFFFFF67452301FFBFC1E80700000028505C33DC22F5051C" \
  | perl -pe 's/([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})/chr(hex($1))/ge' \
  | socat - UNIX-CONNECT:/run/loraham/lora868.sock
```

## Framed DATA sockets

Framed DATA sockets are opt-in binary stream sockets that preserve RF packet boundaries. They are a second interface, not a replacement: raw DATA clients continue to receive raw RF bytes exactly as before, independently of any framed client on the same band.

Both interfaces carry payload only. Status and config broadcasts (`TX=`, `CAD=`, `RSSI=`) go to CONF slots alone and are never written to a DATA or framed DATA socket.

## Frame layout

Every frame, in both directions, is a 3-byte header followed by the payload.

| Offset | Size | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|
| `0` | 1 byte | frame type |
| `1` | 2 bytes | payload length, little-endian `uint16` |
| `3` | `length` bytes | payload |

## Frame types

| Type | Name | Direction | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | `RX_PACKET` | daemon to client | One complete received RF packet with RSSI/SNR metadata |
| `0x02` | `TX_PACKET` | client to daemon | One complete RF packet to transmit |
| `0x03` | `ERROR` | daemon to client | UTF-8 error text |
| `0x04` | `TX_RESULT` | daemon to client | One result per TX, emitted only when enabled with `SET TXRESULT=1` on the matching CONF socket |

## `RX_PACKET` payload

RX metadata is 4 bytes and is placed before the RF bytes.

| Payload offset | Size | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| `0` | 2 bytes | little-endian `int16` | RSSI in centi-dBm, or `-32768` when unavailable |
| `2` | 2 bytes | little-endian `int16` | SNR in centi-dB, or `-32768` when unavailable; FSK always reports unavailable |
| `4` | `rf_len` bytes | bytes | the received RF payload, at most `255` bytes |

The payload length of an `RX_PACKET` frame is therefore `4 + rf_len`.

## `TX_RESULT` payload

The `TX_RESULT` payload length is exactly `4` bytes.

| Payload offset | Size | Type | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| `0` | 1 byte | `uint8` | status |
| `1` | 1 byte | bit mask | flags |
| `2` | 2 bytes | little-endian `uint16` | sequence number |

Status values:

| Value | Name |
|---:|---|
| `0` | `OK` |
| `1` | `BUSY` |
| `2` | `CHANNEL_BUSY` |
| `3` | `RADIO_NOT_READY` |
| `4` | `RADIO_ERROR` |
| `5` | `INVALID_PACKET` |
| `6` | `INVALID_BAND` |

Flag bits:

| Bit | Mask | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|
| `0` | `0x01` | managed-mode attempt |
| `1` | `0x02` | reserved, currently never set |
| `2` | `0x04` | `MANAGED` send-after-CAD-timeout |

## Size limits

| Item | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| RF payload | `255` bytes | Maximum accepted in a `TX_PACKET` and maximum carried inside an `RX_PACKET` |
| RX metadata | `4` bytes | `int16` RSSI in c-dBm followed by `int16` SNR in c-dB |
| Complete `RX_PACKET` frame | `262` bytes | 3-byte header plus 4 metadata bytes plus 255 RF bytes |
| `TX_RESULT` payload | `4` bytes | Exactly, always |

## Framing rules and errors

- A `TX_PACKET` payload must be at most `255` RF bytes and contains no metadata.
- One valid `TX_PACKET` maps to one RF transmit attempt. It is not split, unlike raw DATA stream input.
- One received RF packet is sent to framed clients as exactly one `RX_PACKET` frame.
- Oversized `TX_PACKET` frames and unsupported frame types are rejected with exactly one `ERROR` frame. The parser then re-syncs after the rejected frame's declared payload length, so a following valid frame on the same connection is parsed normally.

## Deferred `TX_RESULT`

When a framed TX is queued, the immediate success `TX_RESULT` is suppressed. The final result is delivered later, as a `TX_RESULT` frame addressed to the framed client slot that originated the transmission.

If that slot has closed or been reused before the completion arrives, the stale final `TX_RESULT` is dropped and counted in `TXQSTALE`. Because the deferred flag bit is never set, deferred delivery is recognisable by the suppressed immediate result rather than by a flag.

## Python examples

Reading one frame, and decoding RX metadata when it is an `RX_PACKET`:

```python
import socket
import struct

SIGNAL_UNAVAILABLE = -32768

def recv_exact(sock, n):
    data = bytearray()
    while len(data) < n:
        chunk = sock.recv(n - len(data))
        if not chunk:
            raise EOFError("socket closed")
        data += chunk
    return bytes(data)

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect("/run/loraham/lora868f.sock")

header = recv_exact(sock, 3)
frame_type, payload_len = struct.unpack("<BH", header)
payload = recv_exact(sock, payload_len)

if frame_type == 0x01:
    rssi_cdbm, snr_cdb = struct.unpack("<hh", payload[:4])
    rf_payload = payload[4:]
    rssi = None if rssi_cdbm == SIGNAL_UNAVAILABLE else rssi_cdbm / 100.0
    snr = None if snr_cdb == SIGNAL_UNAVAILABLE else snr_cdb / 100.0
    print(rssi, snr, rf_payload)
```

Sending one packet:

```python
import socket
import struct

payload = b"Hello LoRaHAM"
frame = struct.pack("<BH", 0x02, len(payload)) + payload

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect("/run/loraham/lora868f.sock")
sock.sendall(frame)
```
